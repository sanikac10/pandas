This foreknowledge proved invaluable, as did her wide travel and exposure to many different teachers with many different points of view.',\n",

              " 'Arnold Hein was the scion of a military nation not far from Rishe’s home country of Hermity, the one in which they now stood. Their kingdoms, so recently at war, had brokered an ostensible peace, and the two ruling families met from time to time. Crown Prince Dietrich’s engagement party would be one such occasion. He’d gathered elites from far and wide to introduce to his beloved Mary.',\n",

              " 'He was an extraordinarily skilled swordsman and, with a powerful military at his back, was destined to conquer kingdom after kingdom. He had done as much in her second, third, fourth, and fifth lives. In her sixth, Rishe had faced him in battle herself and died by his hand.',\n",
              " 'We never had a chance. That war was lost before it began.',\n",
              " 'Arnold’s brilliance lay not in his swordplay but in his skill as a tactician. He set countries up for conquest and knocked them down, swallowing them one by one.',\n",

              " '“Uh, um…” Rishe floundered for an answer.',\n",
              " 'She’d made such a foolish mistake. Arnold’s gaze cut right through her. It felt like he’d see through any lie she told right down to her soul. She remembered this from the battlefield—how his attention alone felt like a sword thrust.',\n",
              " 'But why even bother to lie? They’d never meet again, so who cared what he thought of her? Sure, she harbored a hard feeling or two over the recent slaying, but there was no point complaining about it to this Arnold. Calling him the emperor was boorish, but Rishe was in the process of being forcibly exiled. Why play at diplomacy?',\n",

No work, no study. I shall be utterly useless.”',\n",

              " '“A lethal dose for a grown man would fill a wine glass. They likely got less than a hundredth of that,” Rishe explained to Arnold, not looking up from her work. “Still, the numbness can block their airways with the roots of their tongues. It’s best to lay them on their sides.”',\n",
              " '“Yes, I understand the theory and the solution.” Arnold gazed down at Rishe’s hands. “The part I’m struggling with is why you’re the one telling me this.”',\n",
              " '“Well, I know how to make the antidote,” Rishe said patiently as she muddled the herbs together in the white soup bowl she’d borrowed for her flowers. She crushed them with the back of a spoon before adding another dried flower, crushing that as well, and combining them to form a paste. This process would be easier with a pestle, but she wasn’t about to complain. “This poison is common—it’s cheap and easy to make, which often means the antidote is simple as well.”',\n",
              " 'The antidote was synthesized, in fact, when hunters witnessed a deer showing no symptoms after eating a certain mushroom. They tested those along with other common herbs the deer ate. Rishe mentally thanked them for their scientific rigor as she added a bit of water, straining it all through a cloth.',\n",
              " 'Rishe stood up, brandishing the bowl of bright green medicine. “Boiling would make the antidote more potent, but this works in a pinch.”',\n",
              " 'That was when she noticed the astonished stares. Unsure of what social faux paus she’d perpetrated, she looked away. Oliver was completely stunned. Arnold looked thoughtful. It was imperative the knights were treated as soon as possible, but to Rishe’s dismay, no one was moving. ',\n",
              " 'Do they not trust me? That makes sense. Anyone would be reluctant to use medicine concocted by a complete stranger. But the longer we wait, the harder the poison will become to cure. ',\n",
              " 'She needed to dispel their doubts. Rolling up her sleeve, Rishe approached Arnold and drew his sword from its scabbard. “I need to borrow this for a moment, Your Highness.”',\n",
              " '“What are you—”',\n",
              " 'She pushed the blade against the soft skin of her inner arm. Blood welled up, along with the sharp sting of pain. Nothing compared to her injuries sustained during her life as a knight, though.',\n",
              " 'Arnold did not share her nonchalance. “What do you think you’re doing?!”',\n",
              " 'He grabbed for her arm. She stepped out of his grasp. Was blood truly so shocking? She didn’t have the time to worry about it. Clutching the overfull bowl, Rishe hurried back to the knights.',\n",
              " '“Don’t worry. This isn’t poison,” Rishe said. She demonstrated as much by drizzling it with a spoon over her own fresh wound. It stung. That meant the ingredients were working.',\n",
              " '“This is crushed liquori grass, luqua flowers, and carilya nuts. I’ll swallow some if that’s what it takes to prove it’s safe.” It was horribly bitter; she hoped it wouldn’t come to that. “The paralysis will last for days. Please make up your mind quickly.”',\n",

              " 'In the end, Rishe applied the antidote.',\n",
              " 'The recovery took a few hours. While they waited, Rishe picked herbs in the same meadow she’d been gazing at with yearning from the carriage. A fortuitous turn of events. She found anti-inflammatory herbs and flowers to ease sour bellies, ingredients for curing headaches, and mushrooms for inducing slumber. She wrapped them all up in a handkerchief.',\n",

Some may say that my knowledge is worthless, but it makes no difference to me.” She turned from the balcony, fixing him with a piercing gaze. “I’m the one who decides what I value.”',\n",
              " 'Rishe had clawed free of her mother and father’s indoctrination a long time ago. Man, woman—it didn’t matter. She could do anything. Being queen was not the culmination of her life; she wouldn’t trade her freedom for anything.',\n",

              " '“Huh?”',\n",
              " 'His vehemence took her by surprise. Arnold had every right to demand she act the part of a proper consort. This was a political marriage; Rishe was essentially a hostage, after all.

              " '“Why?”',\n",
              " '“You know why. I’m enamored with you.” Arnold fed her the same line. “I know you said you don’t care about other people’s approval, but I like your asymmetrical talents. I don’t find them useless at all.” ',\n",

              " 'Was this her chamber at home? Or maybe she was a merchant again, spending a night at the desert king’s palace. Perhaps this was her bed of straw from her life as a maid? Her memories met and interwove as she drifted into wakefulness.',\n",

              " 'I’ve got nothing but cleaning on the schedule today. Hostages can sleep in, right? At least a little? Excitement suffused her at the thought, but that was interrupted by a knock on the door.',\n",

              " 'Rishe thought back to yesterday, how he had come all the way out to the balcony. He should have used that spare time to sleep. “He’s in high demand, isn’t he? He was even working on the trip over.”',\n",
              " '“He finished all the work he brought along with us,” Oliver confirmed. “Now he’s dealing with everything that piled up during his visit to Hermity.”',\n",
              " '“Oh.” Rishe grimaced in sympathy. He may have killed her in a past life, but she wouldn’t wish the bureaucracy of kingship on anyone. “It’s a shame he had to put his work on hold to attend a silly engagement party.”',\n",
              " '“No matter. That party was how a committed bachelor finally found a bride.”',\n",

              " 'This wasn’t the first time Rishe had caught Oliver looking at her. It reminded her of the way her noble customers would examine a product, assessing worth and authenticity. Or a merchant weeding out potential merchandise from a wide array of choices.',\n",

              " '“I trained as a squire, actually,” Oliver replied. “But I was injured and dismissed from the order. His Highness took me into his household soon after. I have served him for nearly a decade.”',\n",
